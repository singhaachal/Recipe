    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> In a mixing bowl take the following listed ingredients:

            <ul>
            <li>100 grams softened unsalted butter</li>
            <li>¼ cup tightly packed brown sugar (50 grams)</li>
            <li>¼ cup raw sugar (50 grams)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>¼ cup milk</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Using a wired whisk or an electric beater begin to mix and whip the ingredients..</li>
        <li>Whip till the butter becomes nicely soft and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Place a sieve on top of the bowl. Add 1.25 cups whole wheat flour (150 grams), 1 teaspoon baking powder and ⅛ teaspoon salt in the sieve.

            Make sure that the bottom of the sieve does not touch the whipped butter. You can also sift the flour separately and then add into the whipped butter.</li>
        <li> With a spatula, gently begin to fold the sifted flour into the whipped butter. 
            Fold well. The cookie dough will be sticky.
            Do not knead. You just to fold and bring the whole mixture together..</li>
        <li>Add ½ cup chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the chocolate chips into the cookie dough.
             Cover and refrigerate dough for 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
        <li>After 15 to 20 minutes of refrigeration, you can either take a portion of dough and lightly roll or flatten on tray – or use a cookie press or a scoop a tablespoon from the dough.

            If rolling in your palms, then roll gently with light pressure from your hands. You can flatten the cookies if you want but even without flattening the cookie will spread while baking.
            
            Keep some space around the cookies as they flatten while baking.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven at 190 degrees Celsius (374 degrees Fahrenheit) for 20 minutes. For an OTG, keep both the top and bottom heating elements on. Place the cookie tray in the center rack.        </li>
        <li>Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or till edges turn golden or brown. Do not bake for too long as then cookies will harden up.</li>
        <li>Using a spatula, remove the cookies from the tray and place them on a wired rack. Let the cookies cool completely before storing or serving.</li>
    </ol>
